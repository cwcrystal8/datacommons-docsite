# Curriculum: Data Literacy

## Introduction

"Data Literacy with Data Commons" comprises curriculum/course materials for instructors, students and other practitioners working on or helping others become _data literate_. This includes detailed modules with pedagogical narratives, explanations of key concepts, examples, and suggestions for exercises/projects focused on advancing the _consumption_, _understanding_ and _interpretation_ of data in the contemporary world. In our quest to expand the reach and utility of this material, we assume no background in computer science or programming, thereby removing a key obstacle to many such endeavors.

### Objectives

We embarked on a mission to imagine a Data Literacy curriculum aimed at anyone and everyone who consumes data and aspires to correctly understand and interpret it to help with better decision-making.

We list the following core objectives of such a curriculum:

- Exposing students (and practitioners) to the basics of data comprehension and interpretation.
- Introducing some basic and intermediate data-driven decision making concepts.
- Explicitly cater to the needs of students (and practitioners) who have no prior programming experience and a limited exposure to basic statistical concepts.
- Adopt a narrative-based approach to appeal to a wide range of audiences.
- Grounding most/all examples and illustrative assignments on real data.
- Using as many of the out-of-the-box and freely available data exploration tools to preclude any advanced or specialized knowledge.
- Make the curriculum materials openly available and support extensive customizations for any instructors who wish to adopt components/modules to suit their needs.

### Suggested Prerequisites

We suggest only the following prerequisites for this curriculum:

- High-School level Mathematics (basic).
- High-School level Statistics (basic).

## Modules
{:#modules}

The curriculum modules are listed below along with the table of contents from each module. Click on the module name and references to access all the content in the module.

Note: this is constantly a work in progress and we aim to keep making additions and complete the "TBD" modules over time. If there are discrepancies or if you do not find what you are looking for and/or if you would like to contribute to this effort by helping develop more content (or have suggested corrections), we would love to hear from you at [courses@datacommons.org](mailto:courses@datacommons.org).

**Module 1: [Data Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOMdb9IwrL14be61bxeIaAwOuBrueAELoRJNceE8FLlYP2QE8yEr2px2fGnupUWZAfzq_i00Dco3JJ/pub)**

This module is meant to serve as the introductory class(es) in a data literacy course. It provides motivation for why data literacy matters, introduces key concepts such as measurements, variables, models, etc., and defines some basic descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.

**Module 2: [Deep Dive into Data "Set"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRSLiNxqIQJP3Tp-6eLdz_-Iv5nPp_Q_yS2cY1SbF2wrNbGRsQS26s32fd1gZYrVyarnH8R364G3I3N/pub)**

Introduces students to the idea of a data “set” as well as some basic terms and statistical measures (e.g. mean, standard deviation, etc.) while highlighting important caveats and takeaways when drawing conclusions from these measures.

**Module 3: [Relating Data "Sets"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnJHyjrK85SLlSmlFwzoAi2bA8javVv__apXmeq_N_e4LFmqyB7x1I-ghM2Y0PGXy0K8RWd2I_lny7/pub)**

Introduces students to the idea of related data sets and describes how to merge data sets into one large data collection. Real data sets are analyzed in depth to demonstrate the benefits of building a nuanced, complete picture of the world.

**Module 4: [Plotting/Graphing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQUn3ShN4vdfeXw5o-nXkMHWu9Q6DoyO1Ihk1V0QQ6J3ZaRSB9KhPcgymjvZYA95G86tLQGnsWHNPzd/pub)**

Introduces students to some common plots and graphs and discusses when to use each depending on the data and the context. It also defines and explores various distributions with analysis of their properties and examples from the real world

**Module 5: [Correlations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTKng32E3mwC6whbEXoFw9UyTHMSH9HH-ySoZ-lRlzB0DTXc72i4VmXuYj0a9LjkakQ-w84IkClQM4q/pub)**

Introduces students to the idea of correlation between two variables and describes how to observe, quantify, and label correlations, with a focus on linear correlations. Strategies for distinguishing real correlations from noise are provided and common pitfalls, such as correlation vs causation, are discussed in depth.
  
**Module 6: [Mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ947FunXunwK32SQeKQHSi7F8P97mQusHh4WjgMKtnp-y_MX_sAGosKUDgX7xaKK1QdpMQCsPXaJKV/pub)**

Introduces students to the idea of geographic data and discusses how to visualize and aggregate geographic data.

**Module 7: Time Series**

## How To Use

The curriculum is organized in self-contained modules. Instructors (and students) are welcome to consume or work through any of the modules or the components within any module. Each [module](#modules) is available as a detailed document with several pedagogical notes, objectives and an outline/table of contents to allow easy navigation.

To find what you may be looking for, or to use any content in your own courses/curriculum, we recommend the following approach:

1. Read our [about the course page](about_the_course.html) to familiarize yourself with the curriculum objectives which may explain our curriculum design choices.

2. Navigate to the [key themes section](#key-themes) below. It lists several key themes along with some pointers to specific modules which have the complete details.

3. Navigate to the [topics by module section](#topics-by-module) below. For each module, we show the table of contents. If you find what you are looking for (e.g. search "Categorical vs Numeric Variables" and you should find yourself at the second module). You can then access the module itself for the content.

4. Use search (Ctrl + F) on this page to search for a term or topic you are interested in. If found, navigate to the linked module(s) to find the content.

5. If you do not find the topic/concept you are looking for, please email us at [courses@datacommons.org](mailto:courses@datacommons.org) with suggestions about topics/concepts to add. If you would like to contribute to this endeavor, please do reach out at [courses@datacommons.org](mailto:courses@datacommons.org) and help us add more content.
