DELETEME BEFORE SUBMITTING

Navbar Structure we talked about in meeting:
    Data Literacy with Data Commons
    Overview
    Course Materials <- first paragraph of topics page (update language and links, add how to use bullet point)
        |__ Modules (or Course Material?) <- extract from main page, and add ToC from topics covered
        |__ Key Themes <- section from current "topics covered"
        |__ How to Use
    FAQs

Without updated sidebar logic, you probably won't be able to click into
the course material pages on a local instance. Navigating by url directly
should work though, e.g.

localhost:4000/courseware/data_literacy/course_materials/<page_name>.html
