# Courseware

Data Commons can help develop exciting new course content for several pedagogical use cases. From foundational data science and machine learning courses to more specialized curricula focusing on specific use cases and skills development, e.g. data analytics and analytical tools for public policy, public health etc. All courses and training materials need data, preferably _real world_ data. We take a hands-on approach and work through several examples and case studies to illustrate useful concepts with _real_ data. Instructors and students are welcome to modify any/all components to suit their needs. We encourage you to try different/related datasets which are also available through the Data Commons data graph!
